        process for mass reproducing text and images using a master form or
        template. The earliest non-paper products involving printing include
        cylinder seals and objects such as the Cyrus Cylinder and the
        Cylinders of Nabonidus. The earliest known form of printing as applied
        to paper was woodblock printing, which appeared in China before 220 AD
        for cloth printing. However, it would not be applied to paper until
        the seventh century. Later developments in printing technology include
        the movable type invented by Bi Sheng around 1040 AD and the printing
        press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century. The
        technology of printing played a key role in the development of the
        Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution and laid the material basis
        for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to
        the masses.

        is a method of printing from a digital-based image directly to a
        variety of media.[1] It usually refers to professional printing where
        small-run jobs from desktop publishing and other digital sources are
        printed using large-format and/or high-volume laser or inkjet
        printers. Digital printing has a higher cost per page than more
        traditional offset printing methods, but this price is usually offset
        by avoiding the cost of all the technical steps required to make
        printing plates. It also allows for on-demand printing, short
        turnaround time, and even a modification of the image (variable data)
        used for each impression.[2] The savings in labor and the
        ever-increasing capability of digital presses means that digital
        printing is reaching the point where it can match or supersede offset
        printing technology's ability to produce larger print runs of several
        thousand sheets at a low price.[3]
